Nice, that's the commit that added the `.env` file. We'll need to remove the contents of this commit, as well as the commit that removed it from the history.

## Step 13: Remove historical reference to a previous `.env` file

We can do this with the following commands:

1. Since we cloned the repository earlier, let's run `git checkout main` to put us back on the main branch
1. Run `git pull` to update your local repository with the changes we merged from the contributor's pull request
1. Run `git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" HEAD` to remove the historical reference to the `.env` file

  **Note:** There is a lot going on with this command. We won't be diving into everything this command is doing, but it's filtering through the main branch and removing any cached reference to a `.env` file.

1. Next, let's run `git push -f` to force push this change to the main branch
1. Let's now run `git log --oneline` to get a list of our modified commit history
1. Paste your log output into this issue as a comment
